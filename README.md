# Linear_Regression
Linear regression using different machine learning models

A linear regression consist in find two coefficients, letÂ´s call them 'm' and 'b'.
This coefficients are used in the line ecuation: y = m*x + b, where, for every given value for x
We got a value for 'y' resolving the ecuation, the porpose of this is to find some ecuation that could fit 
well for our data. In our data we will have some values in 2 dimensions, one for an independent variable and other for a
dependient one. The dependent variable will be our values for 'x' so, the linear regression objective is to find some 'm' and 'b' values
that, resolving the ecuation for every 'x', can give us a good aproximation of our data. This is usefull to interpolate interpolation or
to predict future values for our problem.
